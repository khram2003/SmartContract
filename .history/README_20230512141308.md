# SmartContract

I have chosen to complete the third task: `Currency exchange office`.

To deploy it you should install Remix IDE. Then create a folder and move two `.sol` files from this repository to it.

Compile them and deploy them using Remix. Now you can play with them (do not forget to inrease the allowance!).
